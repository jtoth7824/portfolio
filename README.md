## Description

This Portfolio contains contact information for me.   It also displays my body of knowledge and information about what I'm looking for.    There is also a link to my recent projects.    For each of these projects there is a screenshot of the application along with buttons to try out the application or to go directly to the GitHub repository for the code.
